## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

This project helped me to explore the different possibilities that come with using Flexbox. One of the notable ones include; 

```css
.class {
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```
This particular feature came in handy while I wrote the codes for the mobile view. It helped position alternate pictures and texts, that would, otherwise, have been difficult to do without tinkering with the markup already in place. Another interesting object I got more comfortable with, while on this project is the svg. I now understand how to use them a whole lot more than I used to.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I'd like to improve on my use of elements, I mean reuseable elements. Also, my media queries are only getting better and much work still has to be done in that area.



### Useful resources
